# Notification Tester &middot; [![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/svipas/svipas/_apis/build/status/svipas.vscode-notification-tester?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/svipas/svipas/_build/latest?definitionId=3&branchName=master)

This extension triggers VS Code notifications. This is usable if you want to test Notification Center. I created this extension to prepare new coloring for theme which helps me to see how Notification Center looks like in different messages (info/warn/error). Also, you can test progress badge in Source Control with this extension.
